A lightweight, highly secure, monolithic PHP application designed to bulk generate, distribute, and cryptographically verify digital certificates. This system allows organizations, communities, and educational institutions to handle end-to-end credential workflows without relying on expensive SaaS infrastructure like Credly.

## Core Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Visual Editor:** A powerful built-in PDF editor. Upload a blank PDF template and visually map dynamic text fields (Participant Name, Credential ID, Issue Date) and a customizable, brand-colored QR code directly onto the canvas.
- **Bulk CSV Processing:** Effortlessly import hundreds of participants at once using a standardized CSV upload system.
- **Event & Role Isolation:** Manage multiple events simultaneously. Create distinct roles (e.g., Speaker, Volunteer, Attendee) within each event, allowing for role-specific PDF templates.
- **Public Verification Portal:** Includes a public-facing validation endpoint. Anyone can scan a certificate's QR code to instantly verify its authenticity against the central database.
- **1-Click LinkedIn Integration:** Generated certificates provide participants with a dynamic "Add to LinkedIn Profile" button that securely pre-fills their credential data.
- **Enterprise-Grade Security:** Hardened against SQL Injection (PDO prepared statements), CSRF attacks (strict token verification on state-changing endpoints), Session Fixation, and Brute-Force authentication attempts (server-side delays).

## Architecture & Tech Stack

This platform is intentionally built without heavy frameworks to ensure maximum portability across standard shared-hosting environments (cPanel/Hostinger) and minimal dependency overhead.

- **Backend Logic:** PHP 8.x (Vanilla)
- **Database Layer:** MySQL / MariaDB (via PDO)
- **PDF Generation Engine:** FPDI & TCPDF
- **Frontend UI:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (Zero-build pipeline)

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Requirements
Ensure your server or local environment has PHP 8.0+ installed with the `pdo_mysql`, `gd`, and `mbstring` extensions enabled.

### 2. Clone & Setup
Clone the repository to your server's public directory (or `htdocs`):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Deoband-Community-Wikimedia/dcw-certificate-portal.git
cd dcw-certificate-portal
```

### 3. Database Initialization
1. Create a new, empty MySQL database.
2. Import the `database.sql` schema file located in the root directory. This provisions the necessary tables and creates the default administrator account.

### 4. Configuration
Duplicate the example configuration file:
```bash
cp config.example.php config.php
```
Open `config.php` and map it to your newly created database:
```php
$host = 'localhost';
$db   = 'your_database_name';
$user = 'your_database_user';
$pass = 'your_database_password';
```

### 5. File System Permissions
The application requires write access to generate and store PDF assets. Ensure the `uploads/` directory has proper write permissions:
```bash
chmod -R 755 uploads/
```

### 6. First Login
Boot up your server (or run `php -S localhost:8000` locally) and navigate to the admin dashboard:
- **URL:** `http://localhost:8000/admin/login.php`
- **Default Username:** `admin`
- **Default Password:** `password123`

> **[CAUTION] Security Warning:** You must immediately navigate to the **"Manage Users"** tab to rotate the default administrator credentials before exposing the portal to public traffic.

## Production Security

For live production deployments, you must prevent public HTTP access to sensitive configuration files.
An `.htaccess` file is included in this repository to automatically block access to `config.php` and `.git/` directories on Apache servers. If you are deploying on Nginx, you must manually implement equivalent `deny all;` blocks in your server block configuration.

## Contributing

We welcome pull requests, bug reports, and feature ideas. To contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-amazing-feature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: added something amazing'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-amazing-feature`).
5. Open a Pull Request.

Please ensure all new code adheres to the existing security paradigms (strictly use PDO for database queries and include CSRF tokens on all `POST` forms).
